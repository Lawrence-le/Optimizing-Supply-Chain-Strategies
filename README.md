Optimizing Supply Chain Strategies for Tech Haven: Navigating Unit Costs and Demand Uncertainties in the Smartphone Retail Landscape

# Background
Tech Haven, a leading technology retailer with numerous locations across the nation, faces the challenge of efficiently ordering the latest gadgets and distributing them to its individual stores. 

# Scenario
In this case, let's consider a popular new smartphone model, which Tech Haven plans to sell for $800. The unit cost for each device depends on the quantity ordered, and Tech Haven wants to optimize its ordering strategy.

For the smartphone model:

If the number ordered is less than 1000, the unit cost is $700.
After each 1000 units, the unit cost drops:
$690 for at least 1000 units
$680 for at least 2000 units
$670 for at least 3000 units
$660 (the lowest possible unit cost) for at least 4000 units.

Tech Haven faces uncertainty about the demand for this smartphone, estimating that it could range from 500 to 5000 units. Additionally, considering the fast-paced nature of the technology industry, Tech Haven recognizes that newer models will be released, potentially affecting the demand for this specific smartphone.

If there are any unsold smartphones when the next model is released, Tech Haven plans to reduce the price to $500, believing that at this discounted price, all remaining devices will be sold.
